# Summary

Last time we talked about types, variables, and assignment. Today we'll take a more in-depth look at strings and talk about something new called "lists".

# Strings

Recall that strings can look like this:

   - `'a'`, `'abcdef'`, `'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'`,
   -  `"double quotes work too in Python"`, 
   -  `'you can include the \'same kind\' of quote if you "escape" the quote with backslashes, or you can use a different kind of quote without escaping it'`

# Strings

How does Python store these? 

Strings are composed of characters in a certain order. They can be accessed with their *index* (starting from `0`) in the string:

```python
>>> a = "abcdefg"
>>> a[0]
a
>>> a[1]
b
>>> a[6]
g
>>> a[7]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: string index out of range
```
