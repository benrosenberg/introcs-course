# Summary

Last time we talked about types, variables, and assignment. Today we'll take a more in-depth look at strings and talk about something new called "lists".

# Strings

Recall that strings can look like this:

   - `'a'`, `'abcdef'`, `'the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog'`,
   -  `"double quotes work too in Python"`, 
   -  `'you can include the \'same kind\' of quote if you "escape" the quote with backslashes, or you can use a different kind of quote without escaping it'`

# Strings

How does Python store these? 

Strings are composed of characters in a certain order. They can be accessed with their *index* (starting from `0`) in the string:

```python
>>> a = "abcdefg"
>>> a[0]
a
>>> a[1]
b
>>> a[6]
g
>>> a[7]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
IndexError: string index out of range
```

# Strings

To *concatenate* strings together, simply use the usual `+` operator:

```python
>>> a = "abc"
>>> b = "def"
>>> a + b
'abcdef'
```

# Strings

To find a *substring* in a string, use one of the following two methods:

 - `find`
   - Returns `-1` if substring not found
   - Returns index of substring in string otherwise
 - `index`
   - Throws a `ValueError` if the substring is not found
   - Returns index of substring in string otherwise

# Find vs. Index: Example

```python
>>> a = 'abc'
>>> a.find('a')
0
>>> a.find('c')
2
>>> a.find('d')
-1
>>> a.index('d')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: substring not found
```

# Lists

Lists are Python's most versatile data structure. They are like strings in that they can be indexed, but instead of just being an immutable array of characters they can contain pretty much anything. 

Lists are denoted with `[`square brackets`]`, and items are delineated by commas within lists:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a[0]
1
>>> a[2]
3
```

# Lists 

You can add lists together similarly to strings:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> b = [4, 5, 6]
>>> a + b
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

# List methods

Some important list methods are `append` and `pop`:

```python
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> a.append(4)
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> a.pop(0)
1
>>> a
[2, 3, 4]
>>> a.pop()
4
>>> a
[2, 3]
```
