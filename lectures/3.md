# Conditionals

What would you do if you wanted to assign one variable depending on another variable, or on user input?

```python
>>> # This is one way to do it...
>>> hi_or_bye = True
>>> a = ('Hello!' * int(hi_or_bye)) + ('Goodbye' * int(hi_or_bye))
>>> a
'Hello!'
```

But this is inconvenient...

# If-statements

Instead of using complicated arithmetic with casting and booleans to determine how our code should be executed, it's better to use `if`-statements:

```python
>>> hi_or_bye = True
>>> if hi_or_bye:
...     a = 'Hello!'
... else:
...     a = 'Goodbye'
...
>>> a
'Hello!'
```

# If-elif-else

If we wanted to add more different cases, we could use `elif`s:

```python
>>> hi_or_bye = True
>>> yes_or_no = False
>>> if hi_or_bye and yes_or_no:
...     a = 'Hello!'
...     b = 'Yes!'
... elif hi_or_bye:
...     a = 'Hello!'
...     b = 'No.'
... elif yes_or_no:
...     a = 'Goodbye'
...     b = 'Yes!'
... else:
...     a = 'Goodbye'
...     b = 'No.'
```
